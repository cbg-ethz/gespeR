\title{Evaluate the concordance between Phenotype objects}
\usage{
concordance(..., min.overlap = 1, cor.method = "spearman", rbo.p = 0.98,
  rbo.k = NULL, rbo.mid = NULL, uneven.lengths = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{The phenotypes to be evaluated for concordance}

\item{min.overlap}{The minimum number of overlapping genes required}

\item{cor.method}{A character string indicating which correlation coefficient is to be computed}

\item{rbo.p}{The weighting parameter for rank biased overlap (rbo) in [0, 1]. High p implies strong emphasis on top ranked elements}

\item{rbo.k}{The evaluation depth for rank biased overlap extrapolation}

\item{rbo.mid}{The mid point to split a ranked list, e.g. in order to split positive and negative scores choose mid=0}

\item{uneven.lengths}{Indicator if lists have uneven lengths}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{concordance}} object with the following elements:
\item{pair.test}{Indicator of compared phenotypes}
\item{cor}{The correlation between pairs of phenotypes for the same gene}
\item{rbo.top}{The rank biased overlap of genes evaluated at the top of the ranked list}
\item{rbo.bottom}{The rank biased overlap of genes evaluated at the bottom of the ranked list}
\item{jaccard}{The Jaccard index of selected genes}
}
\description{
Measures include the correlation (rho) between pairs of phenotypes for the same gene, the rank biased overlap (\code{\link{rbo}})
of the top and bottom of ranked lists, and the Jaccard index (J) of selected genes.
