\title{Package: Gene-Specific Phenotype EstimatoR}
\description{
This package provides a model to deconvolute off-target confounded RNAi knockdown phentypes, and
methods to investigate concordance between ranked lists of (estimated) phenotypes. The regularized
linear regression model can be fitted using two different strategies. (a) Cross-validation over
regularization parameters optimising the mean-squared-error of the model and (b) stability selection
of covariates (genes) based on a method by Nicolai Meinshausen et al.
