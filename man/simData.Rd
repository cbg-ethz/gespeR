\title{Example phenotype and target relations data}
\description{
The data set contains simulated data for four screens. Each screen consists of a phenotype vector
and target relations between siRNAs and genes, i.e. which siRNA binds which genes (on- and off-targets).
}
\examples{
pheno.a <- Phenotypes(system.file("extdata", "Phenotypes_screen_A.txt", package="gespeR"), type = "SSP", col.id = 1, col.score = 2)
targets.a <- TargetRelations(system.file("extdata", "TR_screen_A.rds", package="gespeR"))
